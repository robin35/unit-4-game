“DIAMONDS ARE A GIRL’S BEST FRIEND” GUESSING GAME!

Thank you for visiting my repository. This project is a random number guessing game using JavaScript.  Here’s a little information on how to play:

	This is a game of strategy and chance.

	At the start of the game, you are given a Random Number.

	There are also four diamonds on the gameboard.

	Each diamond is worth a random number of points.

	When you click on the diamond, you will see the points under “Your Score.”

	The points aggregate so you will have to pay attention as you click on each diamond to determine its point value.

	You win if “Your Score” equals the Random Number and an eleven second clip will play of Marilyn Monroe singing “Diamonds are a Girl’s Best Friend” from her movie “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.”

	You lose if “Your Score” exceeds the Random Number.

	Upon winning, the gameboard will automatically clear and set up the next guess.

	The game will tally your Wins and Losses.  These will not be cleared but will continue to increment until the webpage is refreshed.

Hope you enjoy the game!
